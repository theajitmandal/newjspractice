    *** JavaScript Operators ***
        Javascript operators are the symbols used to perform different types of mathematical and logical computations.

        Example:
            5 + 20 
            Here, 5 and 20 are called operands, + is the operator

        Examples:
            The Assignment Operator = assigns values
            The Addition Operator + adds values
            The Multiplication Operator * multiplies values
            The Comparison Operator > compares values

    *** JavaScript Assignment ***
        The Assignment Operator (=) assigns a value to a variable:

        Assignment Examples:
            let x = 10;

        // Assign the value 5 to x
        let x = 5;
        // Assign the value 2 to y
        let y = 2;
        // Assign the value x + y to z:
        let z = x + y;

    *** JavaScript Addition ***
        The Addition Operator (+) adds numbers:

        Adding:
            let x = 5;
            let y = 2;
            let z = x + y;

    *** JavaScript Multiplication ***
        The Multiplication Operator (*) multiplies numbers:

        Multiplying:
            let x = 5;
            let y = 2;
            let z = x * y;

    *** Types of JavaScript Operators ***
            There are different types of JavaScript operators:

            1. Arithmetic Operators
            2. Assignment Operators
            3. Comparison Operators
            4. String Operators

            6. Bitwise Operators
            7. Ternary Operators
            8. Type Operators

    *** JavaScript Arithmetic Operators ***
        Arithmetic Operators are used to perform arithmetic on numbers:

        Arithmetic Operators Example:
            let a = 3;
            let x = (100 + 50) * a;

        
            Operator	    Description
                +	            Addition
                -	            Subtraction
                *	            Multiplication
                **	            Exponentiation (ES2016)
                /	            Division
                %	            Modulus (Division Remainder)
                ++	            Increment
                --	            Decrement

    Note: Arithmetic operators are fully described in the JS Arithmetic chapter.

    *** JavaScript Assignment Operators ***
        Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables.

        The Addition Assignment Operator (+=) adds a value to a variable.

        Assignment:
            let x = 10;
            x += 5;

        Operator	            Example	            Same As
            =	                x = y	                x = y
            +=	                x += y	                x = x + y
            -=	                x -= y	                x = x - y
            *=	                x *= y	                x = x * y
            /=	                x /= y	                x = x / y
            %=	                x %= y	                x = x % y
            **=	                x **= y	                x = x ** y

    Note: Assignment operators are fully described in the JS Assignment chapter.

    *** JavaScript Comparison Operators ***
        Operator	Description
            ==	        equal to
            ===	        equal value and equal type
            !=	        not equal
            !==	        not equal value or not equal type
            >	        greater than
            <	        less than
            >=	        greater than or equal to
            <=	        less than or equal to
            ?	        ternary operator

    Note: Comparison operators are fully described in the JS Comparisons chapter.

    *** JavaScript String Comparison ***
        All the comparison operators above can also be used on strings:

        Example:
            let text1 = "A";
            let text2 = "B";
            let result = text1 < text2;

        Note that strings are compared alphabetically:

        Example:
            let text1 = "20";
            let text2 = "5";
            let result = text1 < text2;

    *** JavaScript String Addition ***
        The + can also be used to add (concatenate) strings:

        Example:
            let text1 = "John";
            let text2 = "Doe";
            let text3 = text1 + " " + text2;

        The += assignment operator can also be used to add (concatenate) strings:

        Example:
            let text1 = "What a very ";
            text1 += "nice day";

        The result of text1 will be:
            What a very nice day

    Note: When used on strings, the + operator is called the concatenation operator.

    *** Adding Strings and Numbers ***
        Adding two numbers, will return the sum, but adding a number and a string will return a string:

        Example:
            let x = 5 + 5;
            let y = "5" + 5;
            let z = "Hello" + 5;

        The result of x, y, and z will be:
            10
            55
            Hello5

    Note: If you add a number and a string, the result will be a string!
    
    *** JavaScript Logical Operators ***
        Operator	Description
            &&	        logical and
            ||	        logical or
            !	        logical not

    Note: Logical operators are fully described in the JS Comparisons chapter.

    *** JavaScript Type Operators ***
        Operator	            Description
            typeof	                Returns the type of a variable
            instanceof	            Returns true if an object is an instance of an object type

    Note: Type operators are fully described in the JS Type Conversion chapter.

    *** JavaScript Bitwise Operators ***
        Bit operators work on 32 bits numbers.

        Any numeric operand in the operation is converted into a 32 bit number. 
        The result is converted back to a JavaScript number.

        Operator	Description	            Example	    Same as	            Result	        Decimal
        &	            AND	                    5 & 1	    0101 & 0001	        0001	        1
        |	            OR	                    5 | 1	    0101 | 0001	        0101	        5
        ~	            NOT	                    ~ 5	        ~0101	            1010	        10
        ^	            XOR	                    5 ^ 1	    0101 ^ 0001	        0100	        4
        <<	            left shift	            5 << 1	    0101 << 1	        1010	        10
        >>	            right shift	            5 >> 1	    0101 >> 1	        0010	        2
        >>>	            unsigned right shift	5 >>> 1	    0101 >>> 1	        0010	        2

        The examples above uses 4 bits unsigned examples. But JavaScript uses 32-bit signed numbers.
        Because of this, in JavaScript, ~ 5 will not return 10. It will return -6.
        ~00000000000000000000000000000101 will return 11111111111111111111111111111010

        Bitwise operators are fully described in the JS Bitwise chapter.

    *** Exercise ***
        1. Consider the following code:
            let x = 5;
            let y = '8';
            let z = x + y;
            What will be the result of z?               -> 58

        2. Multiply 10 with 5, and alert the result:       -> alert(10*5)
        3. Insert the correct operator to divide 10 by 2:  -> let x = 10/2;
