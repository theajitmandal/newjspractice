    *** JavaScript Assignment Operators ***
        Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables.

    Operator	            Example	                Same As
        =	                    x = y	                x = y
        +=	                    x += y	                x = x + y
        -=	                    x -= y	                x = x - y
        *=	                    x *= y	                x = x * y
        /=	                    x /= y	                x = x / y
        %=	                    x %= y	                x = x % y
        **=	                    x **= y	                x = x ** y

    *** Shift Assignment Operators ***
    Operator	    Example	            Same As
        <<=	            x <<= y	            x = x << y

        >>>=	        x >>>= y	        x = x >>> y

    *** Bitwise Assignment Operators ***
    Operator	    Example	            Same As
        &=	            x &= y	            x = x & y
        ^=	            x ^= y	            x = x ^ y
        |=	            x |= y	            x = x | y

    *** Logical Assignment Operators ***
    Operator	Example	Same As
        &&=	            x &&= y	            x = x && (x = y)
        ||=	            x ||= y	            x = x || (x = y)
        ??=	            x ??= y	            x = x ?? (x = y)

    Note: The Logical assignment operators are ES2020.

    *** The = Operator ***
        The Simple Assignment Operator assigns a value to a variable.

        Simple Assignment Examples:
            let x = 10; -> assigns the value 10 to the variable x
            let x = 10 + y;

    *** The += Operator ***
        The Addition Assignment Operator adds a value to a variable.

        Addition Assignment Example:
            let x = 10;
            x += 5;
            let text = "Hello"; text += " World";
    
    *** The -= Operator ***
        The Subtraction Assignment Operator subtracts a value from a variable.

        Subtraction Assignment Example:
            let x = 10;
            x -= 5;

    *** The *= Operator ***
        The Multiplication Assignment Operator multiplies a variable.

        Multiplication Assignment Example:
            let x = 10;
            x *= 5;

    *** The **= Operator ***
        The Exponentiation Assignment Operator raises a variable to the power of the operand.

        Exponentiation Assignment Example:
            let x = 10;
            x **= 5;

    *** The /= Operator ***
        The Division Assignment Operator divides a variable.

        Division Assignment Example:
            let x = 10;
            x /= 5;

    *** The %= Operator ***
        The Remainder Assignment Operator assigns a remainder to a variable.

        Remainder Assignment Example:
            let x = 10;
            x %= 5;

    *** The <<= Operator ***
        The Left Shift Assignment Operator left shifts a variable.

        Left Shift Assignment Example:
            let x = -100;
            x <<= 5;

    *** The >>= Operator ***
        The Right Shift Assignment Operator right shifts a variable (signed).

        Right Shift Assignment Example:
            let x = -100;
            x >>= 5;

    *** The >>>= Operator ***
        The Unsigned Right Shift Assignment Operator right shifts a variable (unsigned).

        Unsigned Right Shift Assignment Example:
            let x = -100;
            x >>>= 5;

    *** The &= Operator ***
        The Bitwise AND Assignment Operator does a bitwise AND operation on two operands and 
        assigns the result to the the variable.

        Bitwise AND Assignment Example:
            let x = 10;
            x &= 5;

    *** The |= Operator ***
        The Bitwise OR Assignment Operator does a bitwise OR operation on two operands and 
        assigns the result to the variable.

        Bitwise OR Assignment Example:
            let x = 10;
            x |= 5;

    *** The ^= Operator ***
        The Bitwise XOR Assignment Operator does a bitwise XOR operation on two operands and 
        assigns the result to the variable.

        Bitwise XOR Assignment Example:
            let x = 10;
            x ^= 5;

    *** The &&= Operator ***
        The Logical AND assignment operator is used between two values.

        If the first value is true, the second value is assigned.

        Logical AND Assignment Example:
            let x = 10;
            x &&= 5;

    Note: The &&= operator is an ES2020 feature.

    *** The ||= Operator ***
        The Logical OR assignment operator is used between two values.

        If the first value is false, the second value is assigned.

        Logical OR Assignment Example:
            let x = 10;
            x ||= 5;

    Note: The ||= operator is an ES2020 feature.

    *** The ??= Operator ***
        The Nullish coalescing assignment operator is used between two values.

        If the first value is undefined or null, the second value is assigned.

        Nullish Coalescing Assignment Example:
            let x;
            x ??= 5;

    Note: The ??= operator is an ES2020 feature.

    *** Exercises  ***
    1. Consider the following code:
            let x = 5;
            x += 10;
        What will be the result of x?               -> 15
    2. Use the correct assignment operator that will result in x being 15 (same as x = x + y) if x = 10 & y = 5.  
        -> x += y;
    3. Use the correct assignment operator that will result in x being 50 (same as x = x * y) if x = 10 & y = 5.
        -> x *= y
