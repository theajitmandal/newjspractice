    *** JS Introduction ***
    
    JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language.
    JavaScript is the programming language of the Web.
    JavaScript is easy to learn.

    Summary Definition of JS:
        JavaScript (JS) is the most popular lightweight, scripting, and interpreted programming language. 
        It was developed by Brendan Eich in 1995. JavaScript is popular as a scripting language for web pages, 
        mobile apps, web servers, and many other platforms. It is essential for both front-end and 
        back-end developers. It is also called as browser's language. It is the third layer of the layer cake of 
        standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS). JS enables to:
            1. create dynamically updating contents
            2. control multimedia
            3. animate images
            4. display interactive maps
            5. animate 2D/3D graphics
        For Example,
            JS can change the HTML Content
            JS can change the HTML attribute values
            JS can change the HTML Styles (CSS)
            JS can hide/show the HTML elements
            
    JavaScript (JS) is the most popular lightweight, scripting, and interpreted programming language. 
    It was developed by Brendan Eich in 1995. JavaScript is well-known as a scripting language for web pages, 
    mobile apps, web servers, and many other platforms. It is essential for both front-end and back-end developers 
    to have a strong command of JavaScript, as many job roles require fluency in this language. It is also called
    browser's language.

    JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — 
    every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — 
    displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — 
    you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of 
    standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS).

    HTML is the markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to our web content, 
    for example defining paragraphs, headings, and data tables, or embedding images and videos in the page.

    CSS is a language of style rules that we use to apply styling to our HTML content, for example setting 
    background colors and fonts, and laying out our content in multiple columns.

    JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, 
    animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve 
    with a few lines of JavaScript code.)

    *** Why JS? ***
        JavaScript is one of the 3 languages all web developers must learn:

        1. HTML to define the content of web pages
        2. CSS to specify the layout of web pages
        3. JavaScript to program the behavior of web pages:
            It improves the user experience of a web page by converting it from a static page into an interactive one
            and adds behaviour to the web page.

   Here we will learn every version of JavaScript:

        The Original JavaScript ES1 ES2 ES3 (1997-1999)
        The First Main Revision ES5 (2009)
        The Second Revision ES6 (2015)
        The Yearly Additions (2016, 2017 ... 2021, 2022)

    You don't have to get or download JavaScript.
    JavaScript is already running in your browser on your computer, on your tablet, and on your smart-phone.
    JavaScript is free to use for everyone.

    JavaScript References:
        W3Schools maintains a complete JavaScript reference, including all HTML and browser objects.
        The reference contains examples for all properties, methods and events, and is continuously updated 
        according to the latest web standards.

    *** What can JS do? ***
        1. JavaScript Can Change HTML Content
        
            One of many JavaScript HTML methods is getElementById().
            The example below "finds" an HTML element (with id="demo"), 
            and changes the element content (innerHTML) to "Hello JavaScript":

            Example:

            <!DOCTYPE html>
            <html>
            <body>
                <h2>What Can JavaScript Do?</h2>
                <p id="demo">JavaScript can change HTML content.</p>
                <button type="button" onclick='document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello JavaScript!"'>
                    Click Me!
                </button>
            </body>
            </html>

            JavaScript accepts both double and single quotes:

            document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = 'Hello JavaScript';

        2. JavaScript Can Change HTML Attribute Values
            
            In this example JavaScript changes the value of the src (source) attribute of an <img> tag:

            <!DOCTYPE html>
            <html>
            <body>
                <h2>What Can JavaScript Do?</h2>
                <p>JavaScript can change HTML attribute values.</p>
                <p>In this case JavaScript changes the value of the src (source) attribute of an image.</p>
                <button onclick="document.getElementById('myImage').src='pic_bulbon.gif'">Turn on the light</button>
                <img id="myImage" src="pic_bulboff.gif" style="width:100px">
                <button onclick="document.getElementById('myImage').src='pic_bulboff.gif'">Turn off the light</button>
            </body>
            </html>
