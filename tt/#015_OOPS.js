    Object Literal (Object): Object Literal(or simply Object) is simply key:value pair data structure.
    Storing variables and functions together in one container, we can refer this as an object.

    How to create an object?
    1st Way:
        let bioData = {
            myName  : "Ajit Mandal",
            myAge   : 27,
            getData : function(){
                console.log(`My name is ${bioData.myName} and my age is ${bioData.myAge}`);
            }
        }
        console.log(bioData.myName);
        console.log(bioData.getData());

    2nd way:
    No need to write the functions as well after ES6
    THe above line no 11 to 13 can be minimized as:
