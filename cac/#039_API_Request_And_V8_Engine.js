    Learn XMLHttpRequest:
        XMLHttpRequest (XHR) objects are used to interact with servers. 
        You can retrieve data from a URL without having to do a full page refresh. 
        This enables a Web page to update just part of a page without disrupting what the user is doing.

        The XMLHttpRequest.readyState property returns the state an XMLHttpRequest client is in. 
        An XHR client exists in one of the following states:
           Value                       State                       Description
            0	                UNSENT	                Client has been created. open() not called yet.
            1	                OPENED	                open() has been called.
            2	                HEADERS_RECEIVED	    send() has been called, and headers and status are available.
            3	                LOADING	                Downloading; responseText holds partial data.
            4	                DONE	                The operation is complete.
